# trivial-rest #

### TODO ###

* Make the tests pass; use Foo to get basic CRUD working.
* Tidy everything that currently exists
* Add support for BigDecimal serialisation, so Vector works
* Add support for deserialising other resources, so that Spaceship works
* Abstract out the controller, so we can use other web frameworks
* Make validation a client-level coding concern (and some sensible defaults)
* Abstract out the serialiser, and specify them separately for Rest and the Persister
